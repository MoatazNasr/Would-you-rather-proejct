# Would You Rather Project

The final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course.
This project enables the user to play the “Would You Rather?” game.
The game goes like this:
A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”.
Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.
In the app, users are be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.
